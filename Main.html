    Cooking Castle, founded in 1986, started as a humble neighborhood bakery in the heart of a small village.
    With the passion and effort of all the employees our small bakery became a world renowned cooking giant. 
    We now celebrate the launch of our very own cooking website and our cookbooks. 
    Thank you everyone for making this journey possible.
