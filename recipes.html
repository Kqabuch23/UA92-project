            <p>Recipe 1
                Spaghetti Aglio e Olio (Spaghetti with Garlic and Olive Oil):

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<li>8 oz (225g) spaghetti</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
<li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
<li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)</li>
Instructions:

Cook the Spaghetti:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti.
Prepare the Garlic and Oil:

While the spaghetti is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic.
Combine Spaghetti and Garlic Oil:

Add the cooked spaghetti to the pan with the garlic oil. Toss to coat the spaghetti evenly with the oil and garlic. If the pasta seems dry, add some of the reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach your desired consistency.
Season and Garnish:

Season the spaghetti with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Toss again to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in chopped parsley.
Serve:

Divide the spaghetti among plates. If desired, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
Enjoy your homemade Spaghetti Aglio e Olio!

<li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
<li>1/2 cup honey</li>
<li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
